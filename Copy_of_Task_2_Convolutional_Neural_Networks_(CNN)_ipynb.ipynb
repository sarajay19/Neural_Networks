        "4. **Training Process**: Discuss your choice of batch size, number of epochs, and optimizer. How did these decisions impact the training process and the convergence of the model?\n",
        "5. **Loss Function and Metrics**: Explain why you chose the specific loss function and evaluation metrics for this classification task. How do they align with the goal of correctly classifying traffic signs?\n",
        "6. **Regularization Techniques**: If you used regularization methods like dropout or batch normalization, explain why you implemented them and how they helped prevent overfitting in your model.\n",
        "7. **Model Evaluation**: Justify the method you used to evaluate your model's performance on the test set. Why did you select these evaluation techniques, and what insights did they provide about your model's accuracy and generalization ability?\n",
